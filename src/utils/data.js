It is also a municipality， forming part of the greater Kabul Province， and divided into 22 districts. According to estimates in 2020， the population of Kabul is 4.222 million， which includes all the major ethnic groups of Afghanistan. Afghanistan's only city with a population of over 1 million， Kabul serves as its political， cultural and economical center. Rapid urbanization has made Kabul the world's 75th largest city.Kabul is located high up in a narrow valley between the Hindu Kush mountains， with an elevation of 1，790 metres (5，873 ft) making it one of the highest capitals in the world. The city is said to be over 3，500 years old， mentioned since at least the time of the Achaemenid Empire. Located at crossroads in Asia - roughly halfway between Istanbul in the west and Hanoi in the east - it is in a strategic location along the trade routes of South and Central Asia， and a key location of the ancient Silk Road. It has been part of the Achaemenids followed by the Seleucids， Mauryans， Kushans， Kabul Shahis， Saffarids， Samanids， Ghaznavids， Ghurids， Khwarazmians， Qarlughids， Khaljis， Timurids， Mughals， and Hotaks， until finally becoming part of the Durrani Empire (also known as the \"Afghan Empire\") in 1747. Kabul became the capital of Afghanistan in 1776， during the reign of Timur Shah Durrani， the son of Ahmad Shah Durrani.//new_line//In the early 19th century， the British occupied the city， but after establishing foreign relations， they were compelled to withdraw all forces from Afghanistan. The city was occupied by the Soviets in 1979 but they too abandoned it after the 1988 Geneva Accords were signed. A civil war in the 1990s between various rebel groups destroyed much of the city， resulting in many casualties. From late 2001 the city has been continuously rebuilt.Kabul is known for its gardens， bazaars， and palaces， well known examples being the Gardens of Babur and Darul Aman Palace. It was also formerly a mecca for young western hippies. Despite frequent terrorist attacks in the city， mainly by Taliban insurgents， the city continues to develop and was the fifth fastest-growing city in the world as of 2012."

It is located in the centre of the country， enclosed by mountains and hills with Mount Dajt elevating on the east and a slight valley on the northwest overlooking the Adriatic Sea in the distance. Due to its location at the Plain of Tirana and the close proximity to the Mediterranean Sea， the city is particularly influenced by a Mediterranean seasonal climate. It is among the wettest and sunniest cities in Europe， with 2，544 hours of sun per year.Tirana was founded as a city in 1614 by the Ottoman Albanian general Sylejman Pasha Bargjini and flourished by then. The area that today corresponds to the city's territory has been continuously inhabited since the Iron Age. It was inhabited by Illyrians， and was most likely the core of the Illyrian Kingdom of the Taulantii， which in Classical Antiquity was centred in the hinterland of Epidamnus. Following the Illyrian Wars it was annexed by Rome and became an integral part of the Roman Empire. The heritage of that period is still evident and represented by the Mosaics of Tirana. Later， in the 5th and 6th centuries， a Early Christian basilica was built around this site.//new_line//After the Roman Empire split into East and West in the 4th century， its successor the Byzantine Empire took control over most of Albania， and built the Petrelë Castle in the reign of Justinian I.

The harbor is also one of the best protected in the South Pacific， which gives American Samoa a natural advantage because it makes landing fish for processing easier. Tourism， entertainment， food， and tuna canning are its main industries. As of 1993， Pago Pago was the world's fourth-largest tuna processor. It was home to two of the largest tuna companies in the world: Chicken of the Sea and StarKist， which together exported an estimated $445 million in canned tuna to the U.S. mainland. The total value of fish landed in Pago Pago — about $200，000，000 annually — is higher than in any other port in any U.S. state or territory. Pago Pago is the only modern urban center in American Samoa， and the main port of American Samoa. It is also home to the territorial government， all the industry， and most of the commerce in American Samoa. The Greater Pago Pago Metropolitan Area encompasses several villages strung together along Pago Pago Harbor. One of the villages is itself named Pago Pago， and in 2010 that village had a population of 3，656. The constituent villages are: Utulei， Fagatogo， Malaloa， Pago Pago， Satala and Atu'u. Fagatogo is the downtown area， referred to as “town，” and is home to the legislature， while the executive seat is in Utulei. Also in Fagatogo are the Fono， police department， the Port of Pago Pago， and many shops and hotels. In 2000， the Greater Pago Pago area was home to 8，000 residents; by 2010 the population had increased to 15，000.Rainmaker Mountain (Mount Pioa)， which is located in Pago Pago， contributes to a weather pattern that results in the city having the highest annual rainfall of any harbor in the world. It stands protectively over the eastern side of Pago Pago， making the harbor one of the most sheltered deepwater anchorages in the Pacific Ocean.Historically， the strategic location of Pago Pago Bay played a direct role in the political separation of Western and Eastern Samoa. The initial reason that the U.S. was interested in Tutuila was its desire to use Pago Pago Harbor as a coaling station. The town has the distinction of being the southernmost U.S. capital， and the only one located in the Southern Hemisphere."

In 1880， after decades of political infighting， Buenos Aires was federalized and removed from Buenos Aires Province.

As of June 2020， Canberra's estimated population was 431，380.The area chosen for the capital had been inhabited by Indigenous Australians for up to 21，000 years， with the principal group being the Ngunnawal people. European settlement commenced in the first half of the 19th century， as evidenced by surviving landmarks such as St John's Anglican Church and Blundells Cottage. On 1 January 1901， federation of the colonies of Australia was achieved. Following a long dispute over whether Sydney or Melbourne should be the national capital， a compromise was reached: the new capital would be built in New South Wales， so long as it was at least 100 miles (160 km) from Sydney. The capital city was founded and formally named as Canberra in 1913. A blueprint by American architects Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin was selected after an international design contest， and construction commenced in 1913. The Griffins' plan featured geometric motifs and was centred on axes aligned with significant topographical landmarks such as Black Mountain， Mount Ainslie， Capital Hill and City Hill. Canberra's mountainous location makes it the only mainland Australian city where snow-capped mountains can be seen in winter; although snow in the city itself is rare.//new_line//As the seat of the government of Australia， Canberra is home to many important institutions of the federal government， national monuments and museums.

Compared to the national averages， the unemployment rate is lower and the average income higher; tertiary education levels are higher， while the population is younger. At the 2016 Census， 32% of Canberra's inhabitants were reported as having been born overseas.Canberra's design is influenced by the garden city movement and incorporates significant areas of natural vegetation. Its design can be viewed from its highest point at the Telstra Tower and the summit of Mount Ainslie. Other notable features include the National Arboretum， born out of the 2003 Canberra bushfires， and Lake Burley Griffin， named for the city's architects. Highlights in the annual calendar of cultural events include Floriade， the largest flower festival in the Southern Hemisphere， the Enlighten Festival， Skyfire， the National Multicultural Festival and Summernats.

In 2011， Sarajevo was nominated to be the 2014 European Capital of Culture and in 2019， it hosted the European Youth Olympic Festival. In October 2019， Sarajevo was designated as a UNESCO Creative City for placing culture at the center of its development strategies， and is one of the world's eighteen Cities of Film."

Because it had no tribal affiliation and was close to fresh water， the city was planned to be the capital in the mid-1960s when the Bechuanaland Protectorate became an independent nation. The centre of the city is a long strip of commercial businesses， called \"Main Mall\" with a semicircle-shaped area of government offices to its east.  Gaborone is one of the fastest-growing cities in the world， and this has created problems with housing and illegal settlements. The city has also dealt with conflicts spilling into the country from Zimbabwe and South Africa during the 1980s.//new_line//Gaborone is the economic capital as well as the government capital; it is headquarters to numerous companies and the Botswana Stock Exchange.

Among major Latin American cities， it has the highest GDP per capita.Brasilia was a planned city developed by Lúcio Costa， Oscar Niemeyer and Joaquim Cardozo in 1956 in a scheme to move the capital from Rio de Janeiro to a more central location. The landscape architect was Roberto Burle Marx. The city's design divides it into numbered blocks as well as sectors for specified activities， such as the Hotel Sector， the Banking Sector， and the Embassy Sector. Brasilia was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987 due to its modernist architecture and uniquely artistic urban planning.

Brasilia also hosts 124 foreign embassies. The city's international airport connects it to all other major Brazilian cities and some international destinations， and it is the third-busiest airport in Brazil.

  "abstract": "Sofia ( SOH-fee-ə， SOF-; Bulgarian: София， romanized: Sofiya， IPA: [ˈsɔfijɐ] (listen)) is the capital and largest city of Bulgaria. It is situated in the eponymous valley at the foot of the Vitosha mountain in the western parts of the country. The city is built west of the Iskar river， and has many mineral springs， such as the Sofia Central Mineral Baths. It has a humid continental climate. Being in the centre of the Balkans， it is midway between the Black Sea and the Adriatic Sea， and closest to the Aegean Sea.Known as Serdica in Antiquity and Sredets in the Middle Ages， Sofia has been an area of human habitation since at least 7000 BC. The recorded history of the city begins with the attestation of the conquest of Serdica by the Roman Republic in 29 BC from the Celtic tribe Serdi. During the decline of the Roman Empire， the city was raided by Huns， Visigoths， Avars and Slavs. In 809 Serdica was incorporated into the Bulgarian Empire by Khan Krum and became known as Sredets. In 1018， the Byzantines ended Bulgarian rule until 1194， when it was reincorporated by the reborn Bulgarian Empire. Sredets became a major administrative， economic， cultural and literary hub until its conquest by the Ottomans in 1382. From 1530 to 1826， Sofia was the regional capital of Rumelia Eyalet， the Ottoman Empire's key province in Europe. Bulgarian rule was restored in 1878. Sofia was selected as the capital of the Third Bulgarian State in the next year， ushering a period of intense demographic and economic growth.//new_line//Sofia is the 13th largest city in the European Union. It is surrounded by mountainsides， such as Vitosha by the southern side， Lyulin by the western side， and the Balkan Mountains by the north， which makes it the third highest European capital after Andorra la Vella and Madrid. Being Bulgaria's primate city， Sofia is home of many of the major local universities， cultural institutions and commercial companies. The city has been described as the \"triangle of religious tolerance\". This is due to the fact that three temples of three major world religions—Christianity， Islam and Judaism—are situated within one square: Sveta Nedelya Church， Banya Bashi Mosque and Sofia Synagogue. This triangle was recently expanded to a \"square\" and includes the Catholic Cathedral of St Joseph.Sofia has been named one of the top ten best places for start-up businesses in the world， especially in information technologies. Sofia was Europe's most affordable capital to visit in 2013. In 1979， the Boyana Church in Sofia was included onto the World Heritage List， and it was deconstructed in the Second Bulgarian Empire， holding much patrimonial symbolism to the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. With its cultural significance in Southeast Europe， Sofia is home to the National Opera and Ballet of Bulgaria， the National Palace of Culture， the Vasil Levski National Stadium， the Ivan Vazov National Theatre， the National Archaeological Museum， and the Serdica Amphitheatre. The Museum of Socialist Art includes many sculptures and posters that educate visitors about the lifestyle in communist Bulgaria.The population of Sofia declined from 70，000 in the late 18th century， through 19，000 in 1870， to 11，649 in 1878， after which it began increasing. Sofia hosts some 1.24 million residents within a territory of 492 km2， a concentration of 17.9% of the country population within the 200th percentile of the country territory. The urban area of Sofia hosts some 1.54 million residents within 5723 km2， which comprises Sofia City Province and parts of Sofia Province (Dragoman， Slivnitsa， Kostinbrod， Bozhurishte， Svoge， Elin Pelin， Gorna Malina， Ihtiman， Kostenets) and Pernik Province (Pernik， Radomir)， representing 5.16% of the country territory. The metropolitan area of Sofia is based upon one hour of car travel time， stretches internationally and includes Dimitrovgrad in Serbia. The metropolitan region of Sofia is inhabited by a population of 1.67 million."

It is the world's most populous national capital city， with over 21 million residents within an administrative area of 16，410.5 km2 (6336 sq. mi.). It is located in Northern China， and is governed as a municipality under the direct administration of the State Council with 16 urban， suburban， and rural districts. Beijing is mostly surrounded by Hebei Province with the exception of neighboring Tianjin to the southeast; together， the three divisions form the Jingjinji megalopolis and the national capital region of China.Beijing is a global city， and one of the world's leading centers for culture， diplomacy and politics， business and economics， education， language， and science and technology. A megacity， Beijing is the second-largest Chinese city by urban population after Shanghai and is the nation's cultural， educational， and political center. It is home to the headquarters of most of China's largest state-owned companies and houses the largest number of Fortune Global 500 companies in the world， as well as the world's four biggest financial institutions， by total assets. Beijing is the \"billionaire capital of the world\" with the highest number of billionaires living in the city.

The Beijing Daxing International Airport， a second international airport in Beijing， is the largest single-structure airport terminal in the world.Combining both modern and traditional style architectures， Beijing is one of the oldest cities in the world， with a rich history dating back three millennia. As the last of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China， Beijing has been the political center of the country for most of the past eight centuries， and was the largest city in the world by population for much of the second millennium AD. With mountains surrounding the inland city on three sides， in addition to the old inner and outer city walls， Beijing was strategically poised and developed to be the residence of the emperor and thus was the perfect location for the imperial capital. The city is renowned for its opulent palaces， temples， parks， gardens， tombs， walls and gates. It has seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites—the Forbidden City， Temple of Heaven， Summer Palace， Ming Tombs， Zhoukoudian， and parts of the Great Wall and the Grand Canal—all of which are popular tourist locations. Siheyuans， the city's traditional housing style， and hutongs， the narrow alleys between siheyuans， are major tourist attractions and are common in urban Beijing.//new_line//Many of Beijing's 91 universities consistently rank among the best in the Asia-Pacific and the world. Beijing is home to the two best C9 League universities (Tsinghua and Peking) in the Asia-Pacific and emerging countries. Beijing CBD is a center for Beijing's economic expansion， with the ongoing or recently completed construction of multiple skyscrapers.

  "abstract": "Bogotá (， also UK: ， US: ， Spanish: [boɣoˈta] (listen))， officially Bogotá， Distrito Capital， abbreviated Bogotá， D.C.， and formerly known as Santa Fe de Bogotá during the Spanish period and between 1991 and 2000， is the capital and largest city of Colombia， administered as the Capital District， as well as the capital of the department of Cundinamarca. Bogotá is a territorial entity of the first order， with the same administrative status as the departments of Colombia. It is the political， economic， administrative and industrial centre of the country.//new_line//Bogotá was founded as the capital of the New Kingdom of Granada on 6 August 1538， by Spanish conquistador Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada after a harsh expedition into the Andes conquering the Muisca. The Muisca were the indigenous inhabitants of the region， and they called the place of the foundation \"Thybzaca\" or \"Old Town\". The name of Bogotá corresponds to the Spanish pronunciation of the Chibcha Bacatá (or Mueketá) which was the name of a neighboring settlement located between the modern towns of Funza and Cota. There are different opinions about the meaning of the word Bacatá， the most accepted being that it means \"walling of the farmland\" in the Chibcha language. Another popular translation argues that it means \"The Lady of the Andes\". Further， the word 'Andes' in the Aymara language means \"shining mountain\"， thus rendering the full lexical signification of Bogotá as \"The Lady of the shining mountain\" (notice， however， that the language of the Muisca people was not Aymara but Chibcha). Others suggest that Bacatá was the name of the Muisca cacique who governed the land before the Spaniards arrived. Jiménez de Quesada gave the settlement the name of \"Our Lady of Hope\" but the Spanish crown gave it the name of Santafé (Holy Faith) in 1540 when it was appointed as a city.Santafé became the seat of the government of the Spanish Royal Audiencia of the New Kingdom of Granada (created in 1550)， and then after 1717 it was the capital of the Viceroyalty of New Granada. After the Battle of Boyacá on 7 August 1819， Bogotá became the capital of the independent nation of Gran Colombia. It was Simón Bolívar who rebaptized the city with the name of Bogotá， as a way of honoring the Muisca people and as an emancipation act towards the Spanish crown. Hence， since the Viceroyalty of New Granada's independence from the Spanish Empire and during the formation of present-day Colombia， Bogotá has remained the capital of this territory.//new_line//The city is located in the centre of Colombia， on a high plateau known as the Bogotá savanna， part of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense located in the Eastern Cordillera of the Andes. Bogotá is the third-highest capital in South America and in the world after Quito and La Paz， at an average of 2，640 metres (8，660 ft) above sea level. Subdivided into 20 localities， Bogotá has an area of 1，587 square kilometres (613 square miles) and a relatively cool climate that is constant through the year.//new_line//The city is home to central offices of the executive branch (Office of the President)， the legislative branch (Congress of Colombia) and the judicial branch (Supreme Court of Justice， Constitutional Court， Council of State and the Superior Council of Judicature) of the Colombian government. Bogotá stands out for its economic strength and associated financial maturity， its attractiveness to global companies and the quality of human capital. It is the financial and commercial heart of Colombia， with the most business activity of any city in the country. The capital hosts the main financial market in Colombia and the Andean natural region， and is the leading destination for new foreign direct investment projects coming into Latin America and Colombia. It has the highest nominal GDP in the country， responsible for almost a quarter of the nation's total (24.7%).//new_line//The city's airport， El Dorado International Airport， named after the mythical El Dorado， handles the largest cargo volume in Latin America， and is third in number of people. Bogotá is home to the largest number of universities and research centres in the country， and is an important cultural centre， with many theaters， libraries and museums. Bogotá ranks 52nd on the Global Cities Index 2014， and is considered a global city type \"Beta +\" by GaWC in 2020."

Beginning in the 17th century， it consolidated its position as a regional centre of power with its institutions， defences， and armed forces. During the Renaissance the city served as the de facto capital being the seat of government of the Kalmar Union， governing the entire present day Nordic region in a personal union with Sweden and Norway ruled by the Danish monarch serving as the head of state. The city flourished as the cultural and economic center of Scandinavia under the union for well over 120 years， starting in the 15th century up until the beginning of the 16th century when the union was dissolved with Sweden leaving the union through a rebellion. After a plague outbreak and fire in the 18th century， the city underwent a period of redevelopment. This included construction of the prestigious district of Frederiksstaden and founding of such cultural institutions as the Royal Theatre and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts. After further disasters in the early 19th century when Horatio Nelson attacked the Dano-Norwegian fleet and bombarded the city， rebuilding during the Danish Golden Age brought a Neoclassical look to Copenhagen's architecture. Later， following the Second World War， the Finger Plan fostered the development of housing and businesses along the five urban railway routes stretching out from the city centre.//new_line//Since the turn of the 21st century， Copenhagen has seen strong urban and cultural development， facilitated by investment in its institutions and infrastructure. The city is the cultural， economic and governmental centre of Denmark; it is one of the major financial centres of Northern Europe with the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. Copenhagen's economy has seen rapid developments in the service sector， especially through initiatives in information technology， pharmaceuticals and clean technology. Since the completion of the Øresund Bridge， Copenhagen has become increasingly integrated with the Swedish province of Scania and its largest city， Malmö， forming the Øresund Region. With a number of bridges connecting the various districts， the cityscape is characterised by parks， promenades， and waterfronts. Copenhagen's landmarks such as Tivoli Gardens， The Little Mermaid statue， the Amalienborg and Christiansborg palaces， Rosenborg Castle Gardens， Frederik's Church， and many museums， restaurants and nightclubs are significant tourist attractions.//new_line//Copenhagen is home to the University of Copenhagen， the Technical University of Denmark， Copenhagen Business School and the IT University of Copenhagen. The University of Copenhagen， founded in 1479， is the oldest university in Denmark. Copenhagen is home to the F.C. Copenhagen. The annual Copenhagen Marathon was established in 1980. Copenhagen is one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in the world.//new_line//The Copenhagen Metro， launched in 2002， serves central Copenhagen. Additionally， the Copenhagen S-train， the Lokaltog (private railway)， and the Coast Line network serve and connect central Copenhagen to outlying boroughs. Serving roughly two million passengers a month， Copenhagen Airport， Kastrup， is the busiest airport in the Nordic countries."

Both national and local governments have taken steps to improve and expand infrastructure as well as to reduce poverty in the city."

The Hungarians arrived in the territory in the late 9th century， but the area was pillaged by the Mongols in 1241–42. Re-established Buda became one of the centres of Renaissance humanist culture by the 15th century.//new_line//The Battle of Mohács， in 1526， was followed by nearly 150 years of Ottoman rule. After the reconquest of Buda in 1686， the region entered a new age of prosperity， with Pest-Buda becoming a global city after the unification of Buda， Óbuda， and Pest on 17 November 1873， with the name 'Budapest' given to the new capital. Budapest also became the co-capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire， a great power that dissolved in 1918， following World War I. The city was the focal point of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848， the Battle of Budapest in 1945， and the Hungarian Revolution of 1956.Budapest is a Beta + global city with strengths in commerce， finance， media， art， fashion， research， technology， education， and entertainment.

It has province level status which had a population of 10，562，088 as of 2020. Although Jakarta extends over only 699.5 square kilometres (270.1 sq mi)， and thus has the smallest area of any Indonesian province， its metropolitan area covers 6，392 square kilometres (2，468 sq mi)， and is the world's second-most populous urban area， after Tokyo. It has a population of about 35.934 million as of 2020. Jakarta's business opportunities， and its ability to offer a potentially higher standard of living than is available in other parts of the country， have attracted migrants from across the Indonesian archipelago， making it a melting pot of numerous cultures. Jakarta's nickname is \"the Big Durian\"， after the thorny， strong-smelling fruit of that name that is native to the region. Calling Jakarta \"the Big Durian\" is seen as a nod to New York's nickname， \"the Big Apple\".Jakarta is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in Southeast Asia. Established in the fourth century as Sunda Kelapa， the city became an important trading port for the Sunda Kingdom. At one time， it was the de facto capital of the Dutch East Indies， when it was known as Batavia. Jakarta was officially a city within West Java until 1960， when its official status was changed to a province with special capital region distinction. As a province， its government consists of five administrative cities and one administrative regency. Jakarta is an alpha world city and is the seat of the ASEAN secretariat， making it an important city for international diplomacy. Financial institutions such as the Bank of Indonesia， Indonesia Stock Exchange， and corporate headquarters of numerous Indonesian companies and multinational corporations are located in the city. In 2017， the city's GRP PPP was estimated at US$483.4 billion.Jakarta's primary challenges include rapid urban growth， ecological breakdown， gridlocked traffic， congestion， and flooding. Jakarta is sinking up to 17 cm (6.7 inches) per year， which， coupled with the rising of sea levels， has made the city more prone to flooding. It is one of the fastest-sinking capitals in the world. In August 2019， as a result of these challenges， President Joko Widodo announced that the capital of Indonesia would be moved from Jakarta to the province of East Kalimantan on the island of Borneo."

  "abstract": "Jerusalem (; Hebrew: יְרוּשָׁלַיִם‎ Yerushaláyim; Arabic: القُدس‎ al-Quds or Bayt al-Maqdis， also spelled Baitul Muqaddas) is a city in Western Asia， on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. It is one of the oldest cities in the world， and is considered holy to the three major Abrahamic religions—Judaism， Christianity， and Islam. Both Israel and the Palestinian Authority claim Jerusalem as their capital， as Israel maintains its primary governmental institutions there and the State of Palestine ultimately foresees it as its seat of power; however， neither claim is widely recognized internationally.Throughout its long history， Jerusalem has been destroyed at least twice， besieged 23 times， captured and recaptured 44 times， and attacked 52 times. The part of Jerusalem called the City of David shows first signs of settlement in the 4th millennium BCE， in the shape of encampments of nomadic shepherds. In the Canaanite period (14th century BCE)， Jerusalem was named as Urusalim on ancient Egyptian tablets， probably meaning \"City of Shalem\" after a Canaanite deity. During the Israelite period， significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 9th century BCE (Iron Age II)， and in the 8th century the city developed into the religious and administrative center of the Kingdom of Judah. In 1538， the city walls were rebuilt for a last time around Jerusalem under Suleiman the Magnificent. Today those walls define the Old City， which has been traditionally divided into four-quarters—known since the early 19th century as the Armenian， Christian， Jewish， and Muslim Quarters. The Old City became a World Heritage Site in 1981， and is on the List of World Heritage in Danger. Since 1860 Jerusalem has grown far beyond the Old City's boundaries. In 2015， Jerusalem had a population of some 850，000 residents， comprising approximately 200，000 secular Jewish Israelis， 350，000 Haredi Jews and 300，000 Palestinians. In 2016， the population was 882，700， of which Jews comprised 536，600 (60.8%)， Muslims 319，800 (36.2%)， Christians 15，800 (1.8%)， and 10，300 unclassified (1.2%).According to the Bible， King David conquered the city from the Jebusites and established it as the capital of the united kingdom of Israel， and his son， King Solomon， commissioned the building of the First Temple. Modern scholars argue that Jews branched out of the Canaanite peoples and culture through the development of a distinct monolatrous – and later monotheistic – religion centered on El/Yahweh， These foundational events， straddling the dawn of the 1st millennium BCE， assumed central symbolic importance for the Jewish people. The sobriquet of holy city (עיר הקודש， transliterated 'ir haqodesh) was probably attached to Jerusalem in post-exilic times. The holiness of Jerusalem in Christianity， conserved in the Septuagint which Christians adopted as their own authority， was reinforced by the New Testament account of Jesus's crucifixion there. In Sunni Islam， Jerusalem is the third-holiest city， after Mecca and Medina. In Islamic tradition， in 610 CE it became the first qibla， the focal point for Muslim prayer (salat)， and Muhammad made his Night Journey there ten years later， ascending to heaven where he speaks to God， according to the Quran. As a result， despite having an area of only 0.9 km2 (3⁄8 sq mi)， the Old City is home to many sites of seminal religious importance， among them the Temple Mount with its Western Wall， Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque， and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Outside the Old City stands the Garden Tomb.//new_line//Today， the status of Jerusalem remains one of the core issues in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War， West Jerusalem was among the areas captured and later annexed by Israel while East Jerusalem， including the Old City， was captured and later annexed by Jordan. Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan during the 1967 Six-Day War and subsequently annexed it into Jerusalem， together with additional surrounding territory. One of Israel's Basic Laws， the 1980 Jerusalem Law， refers to Jerusalem as the country's undivided capital. All branches of the Israeli government are located in Jerusalem， including the Knesset (Israel's parliament)， the residences of the Prime Minister (Beit Aghion) and President (Beit HaNassi)， and the Supreme Court. While the international community rejected the annexation as illegal and treats East Jerusalem as Palestinian territory occupied by Israel， Israel has a stronger claim to sovereignty over West Jerusalem."

The city has been a major human settlement for almost three millennia. With 2，860，009 residents in 1，285 km2 (496.1 sq mi)， it is also the country's most populated comune. It is the third most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. It is the centre of the Metropolitan City of Rome， which has a population of 4，355，725 residents， thus making it the most populous metropolitan city in Italy. Its metropolitan area is the third-most populous within Italy. Rome is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula， within Lazio (Latium)， along the shores of the Tiber. Vatican City (the smallest country in the world) is an independent country inside the city boundaries of Rome， the only existing example of a country within a city; for this reason Rome has sometimes been defined as the capital of two states.Rome's history spans 28 centuries. While Roman mythology dates the founding of Rome at around 753 BC， the site has been inhabited for much longer， making it one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in Europe. The city's early population originated from a mix of Latins， Etruscans， and Sabines. Eventually， the city successively became the capital of the Roman Kingdom， the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire， and is regarded by many as the first ever Imperial city and metropolis. It was first called The Eternal City (Latin: Urbs Aeterna; Italian: La Città Eterna) by the Roman poet Tibullus in the 1st century BC， and the expression was also taken up by Ovid， Virgil， and Livy. Rome is also called \"Caput Mundi\" (Capital of the World). After the fall of the Empire in the west， which marked the beginning of the Middle Ages， Rome slowly fell under the political control of the Papacy， and in the 8th century it became the capital of the Papal States， which lasted until 1870. Beginning with the Renaissance， almost all popes since Nicholas V (1447–1455) pursued a coherent architectural and urban programme over four hundred years， aimed at making the city the artistic and cultural centre of the world. In this way， Rome became first one of the major centres of the Renaissance， and then the birthplace of both the Baroque style and Neoclassicism. Famous artists， painters， sculptors and architects made Rome the centre of their activity， creating masterpieces throughout the city. In 1871， Rome became the capital of the Kingdom of Italy， which， in 1946， became the Italian Republic.//new_line//In 2019， Rome was the 11th most visited city in the world with 10.1 million tourists， the third most visited in the European Union， and the most popular tourist destination in Italy. Its historic centre is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. Host city for the 1960 Summer Olympics， Rome is also the seat of several specialised agencies of the United Nations， such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)， the World Food Programme (WFP) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). The city also hosts the Secretariat of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) as well as the headquarters of many international business companies such as Eni， Enel， TIM， Leonardo S.p.A.， and national and international banks such as Unicredit and BNL. Rome's EUR business district is the home of many companies involved in the oil industry， the pharmaceutical industry， and financial services. The presence of renowned international brands in the city have made Rome an important centre of fashion and design， and the Cinecittà Studios have been the set of many Academy Award–winning movies."

Since 1943， the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has administered the prefecture's 23 special wards (formerly Tokyo City)， various bed towns in the western area， and two outlying island chains.//new_line//Tokyo is the largest urban economy in the world by gross domestic product， and is categorized as an Alpha+ city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. Part of an industrial region that includes the cities of Yokohama， Kawasaki， and Chiba， Tokyo is Japan's leading center of business and finance. In 2019， it hosted 36 of the Fortune Global 500 companies. In 2020， it ranked fourth on the Global Financial Centres Index， behind New York City， London， and Shanghai. Tokyo has the world's tallest tower Tokyo Skytree and the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility MAOUDC. The Tokyo Metro Ginza Line is the oldest underground metro line in East Asia (1927).The city has hosted multiple international events， including the 1964 Summer Olympics and three G7 Summits (1979， 1986， and 1993); it will also host the 2020 Summer Olympics， which were ultimately postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Tokyo is an international center of research and development and is represented by several major universities， notably the University of Tokyo. Tokyo Station is the central hub for Japan's Shinkansen bullet train system， and the city is served by an extensive network of rail and subways.

  "abstract": "Amman (English:  ; Arabic: عَمَّان‎， ʻammān pronounced [ʕamːaːn]) is the capital and largest city of Jordan and the country's economic， political and cultural centre. With a population of 4，007，526， Amman is the largest city in the Levant region and the sixth-largest city in the Arab world.The earliest evidence of settlement in Amman is in a Neolithic site known as 'Ain Ghazal， where some of the oldest human statues ever found dating to 7250 BC were uncovered. During the Iron Age， the city was known as Ammon， home to the Kingdom of the Ammonites. It was named Philadelphia during its Greek and Roman periods， and was finally called Amman during the Islamic period. For much of the early and middle Islamic periods (7th–14th centuries)， it served as a center for the Balqa district of Syria. Afterwards， Amman was a largely abandoned site until the late 19th century when Circassian immigrants were settled there by the Ottoman Empire in 1878. The first municipal council was established in 1909.Amman witnessed rapid growth after its designation as Transjordan's capital in 1921， and after several successive waves of refugees: Palestinians in 1948 and 1967; Iraqis in 1990 and 2003; and Syrians since 2011. It was initially built on seven hills but now spans over 19 hills combining 22 areas， which are administered by the Greater Amman Municipality headed by its mayor Yousef Shawarbeh. Areas of Amman have gained their names from either the hills (Jabal) or the valleys (Wadi) they occupy， such as Jabal Lweibdeh and Wadi Abdoun. East Amman is predominantly filled with historic sites that frequently host cultural activities， while West Amman is more modern and serves as the economic center of the city.Approximately two million visitors arrived in Amman in 2014， which made it the 93rd most visited city in the world and the 5th most visited Arab city. Amman has a relatively fast growing economy， and it is ranked as a Beta− global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. Moreover， it was named one of the Middle East and North Africa's best cities according to economic， labor， environmental， and socio-cultural factors. The city is among the most popular locations in the Arab world for multinational corporations to set up their regional offices， alongside Doha and only behind Dubai. It is expected that in the next 10 years these three cities will capture the largest share of multinational corporation activity in the region."

It is affectionately called \"The Mermaid of the Mediterranean\" (عروسة البحر ʿArūsat al-Baḥr; lit: 'bride of the sea')， describing its turquoise waters and its whitewashed buildings. Tripoli is a Greek name that means 'Three Cities'， introduced in Western European languages through the Italian Tripoli.

If it were an independent country in 2013， Mexico City would be the fifth-largest economy in Latin America， five times as large as Costa Rica and about the same size as Peru.Mexico's capital is both the oldest capital city in the Americas and one of two founded by indigenous people， the other being Quito， Ecuador. The city was originally built on an island of Lake Texcoco by the Aztecs in 1325 as Tenochtitlan， which was almost completely destroyed in the 1521 Siege of Tenochtitlan and subsequently redesigned and rebuilt in accordance with the Spanish urban standards. In 1524， the municipality of Mexico City was established， known as México Tenochtitlán， and as of 1585， it was officially known as Ciudad de México (Mexico City). Mexico City was the political， administrative， and financial center of a major part of the Spanish colonial empire. After independence from Spain was achieved， the federal district was created in 1824.//new_line//After years of demanding greater political autonomy， residents were finally given the right to elect both a head of government and the representatives of the unicameral Legislative Assembly by election in 1997. Ever since， left-wing parties (first the Party of the Democratic Revolution and later the National Regeneration Movement) have controlled both of them. The city has several progressive policies， such as abortion on demand， a limited form of euthanasia， no-fault divorce， and same-sex marriage.//new_line//On 29 January 2016， it ceased to be the Federal District (Spanish: Distrito Federal or D.F.) and is now officially known as Ciudad de México (or CDMX)， with a greater degree of autonomy. A clause in the Constitution of Mexico， however， prevents it from becoming a state within the Mexican federation， as it is the seat of power in the country， unless the capital of the country were to be relocated elsewhere."

  "abstract": "Monaco ( (listen); French pronunciation: ​[mɔnako])， officially the Principality of Monaco (French: Principauté de Monaco)， is a sovereign city-state and microstate on the French Riviera close to the Italian region of Liguria， in Western Europe. Bordered by France to the north， east and west， it is lapped by the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The principality is home to 38，682 residents， of whom 9，486 are Monégasque nationals; it is widely recognised for being one of the most expensive and wealthiest places in the world. The official language is French， although Monégasque (a dialect of Ligurian)， Italian and English are spoken and understood by a sizeable group.With an area of 2.1 km2 (0.81 sq mi)， it is the second smallest sovereign state in the world， after Vatican City. Its 19，009 inhabitants per square kilometre (49，230/sq mi) make it the most densely-populated sovereign state in the world. Monaco has a land border of 5.47 km (3.40 mi) and the world's shortest coastline of approximately 3.83 km (2.38 mi); it has a width that varies between 1，700 and 349 m (5，577 and 1，145 ft). The highest point in the state is a narrow pathway named Chemin des Révoires on the slopes of Mont Agel， in the Les Révoires ward， which is 161 metres (528 feet) above sea level. The principality is about 15 km (9.3 mi) from the border with Italy. Its most populous ward is Larvotto/Bas Moulins with a population of 5，443 as of 2008. Through land reclamation， Monaco's land mass has expanded by 20 percent. In 2005， it had an area of only 1.974 km2 (0.762 sq mi). The principality is governed under a form of constitutional monarchy， with Prince Albert II as head of state. Although Prince Albert II is a constitutional monarch， he wields immense political power; the Minister of State is the head of government. The officeholder can be either a Monégasque or French citizen; the monarch consults with the Government of France before an appointment. The House of Grimaldi has ruled Monaco， with brief interruptions， since 1297. The state's sovereignty was officially recognised by the Franco-Monégasque Treaty of 1861， with Monaco becoming a full United Nations voting member in 1993. Despite Monaco's independence and separate foreign policy， its defence is the responsibility of France. However， Monaco does maintain two small military units.//new_line//Economic development was spurred in the late 19th century with the opening of the state's first casino， the Monte Carlo Casino， as well as a railway connection to Paris. Since then， Monaco's mild climate， scenery and gambling facilities have contributed to the principality's status as a tourist destination and recreation centre for the rich. In more recent years， Monaco has become a major banking centre and has sought to diversify its economy into the services sector and small， high-value-added， non-polluting industries. The state has no income tax， low business taxes and is well known for being a tax haven. Over 30% of the resident population are millionaires， with real estate prices reaching €100，000 ($142，000) per square metre in 2018. Monaco is not formally a part of the European Union (EU)， but it participates in certain EU policies， including customs and border controls. Through its relationship with France， Monaco uses the euro as its sole currency; prior to this it used the Monégasque franc. Monaco joined the Council of Europe in 2004 and is a member of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie (OIF). It is also the host of the annual street circuit motor race Monaco Grand Prix， one of the original Grands Prix of Formula One and birthplace of Scuderia Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc. The principality has a club football team， AS Monaco， who compete in the French Ligue 1 and have become French champions on multiple occasions. A centre of research into marine conservation， Monaco is home to one of the world's first protected marine habitats， an Oceanographic Museum and the International Atomic Energy Agency Environment Labs， which is the only marine laboratory in the United Nations structure."

The city is named after chief Maputsu I of the Tembe clan， a subgroup of the Tsonga people. Located near the southern end of the country， it is positioned within 120 km (75 miles) of the Eswatini and South Africa borders. The city has a population of 1，088，449 (as of 2017) distributed over a land area of 347，69 km2 (134 sq mi). The Maputo metropolitan area includes the neighbouring city of Matola， and has a total population of 2，717，437. Maputo is a port city， with an economy centered on commerce. It is also noted for its vibrant cultural scene and distinctive， eclectic architecture.Maputo is situated on a large natural bay on the Indian Ocean， near where the rivers Tembe， Mbuluzi， Matola and Infulene converge. The city consists of seven administrative divisions， which are each subdivided into quarters or bairros. The city is surrounded by Maputo Province， but is administered as a self-contained， separate province since 1998. Maputo City is the geographically smallest and most densely populated province in Mozambique. Maputo is a cosmopolitan city， with Bantu， Tsonga languages being more common， Portuguese， and， to a lesser extent， Arabic， Indian， and Chinese languages and cultures present.//new_line//The area on which Maputo stands was first settled as a fishing village by ancient Tsonga people. It was soon named Lourenço Marques， after the navigator of the same name who explored the area in 1544. The modern city traces its origins to a Portuguese fort established on the site in 1781. A town grew around the fort starting around 1850， and in 1877 it was elevated to city status. In 1898， the colony of Portuguese Mozambique relocated its capital there. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries， Lourenço Marques grew both in population and economic development as a port city. Upon Mozambican independence in 1975， the city became the national capital and was renamed Maputo. During the Mozambican Civil War， the city's economy was devastated. When the war ended， the FRELIMO government launched a program to revive the city's economy， and to clean up the city by forcibly removing criminals， squatters， and undocumented residents. Since then， Maputo's economy has recovered and stability has returned， though crime remains a problem.Maputo has a number of landmarks， including Independence Square， City Hall， Maputo Fortress， the central market， Tunduru Gardens， and Maputo Railway Station. Maputo is known as an aesthetically attractive， if dilapidated， city. With wide avenues lined by jacaranda and acacia trees， it has earned the nicknames City of Acacias and the Pearl of the Indian Ocean. The city is known for its distinct， eclectic architecture， with Portuguese colonial Neoclassical and Manueline styles alongside modern Art Deco， Bauhaus， and Brutalist buildings. The historic Baixa de Maputo district is the downtown area. Maputo has a vibrant cultural scene， with many restaurants， music and performance venues， and local film industry. Maputo's economy is centered around its port， through which much of Mozambique's imports and exports are shipped. The chief exports include cotton， sugar， chromite， sisal， copra， and hardwood. In addition to trade， the city has robust manufacturing and service sectors. Several colleges and universities are located in Maputo， including Pedagogical University， São Tomás University， Catholic University of Mozambique， and Eduardo Mondlane University， the oldest in the country."

It is located at the south-western tip of the North Island， between Cook Strait and the Remutaka Range. Wellington is the major population centre of the southern North Island， and is the administrative centre of the Wellington Region， which also includes the Kapiti Coast and the Wairarapa. It is the world's southernmost capital of a sovereign state. Wellington features a temperate maritime climate， and is the world's windiest city by average wind speed.The position of Wellington as capital of New Zealand is not defined in legislation， but established by convention. Its metropolitan area， considered the greatest extent of Wellington itself， comprises four local authorities: Wellington City， on the peninsula between Cook Strait and Wellington Harbour， contains the central business district; Porirua on Porirua Harbour to the north is notable for its large Māori and Pacific Island communities; Lower Hutt and Upper Hutt are largely suburban areas to the northeast， together known as the Hutt Valley. The Wellington urban area， which only includes urbanised areas within Wellington City， has a population of 215，100 residents as of June 2020. The urban areas of the four local authorities have a combined population of 429，700 residents as of June 2020.As the nation's capital since 1865， the New Zealand Government and Parliament， the Supreme Court， and most of the public service are based in the city. Architectural sights include the Old Government Buildings—one of the largest wooden buildings in the world—as well as the iconic Beehive， the executive wing of Parliament Buildings. Wellington is also home to several of the largest and oldest cultural institutions in the nation， such the National Archives， the National Library， the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa， and numerous theatres. It plays host to many artistic and cultural organisations， including the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra and Royal New Zealand Ballet. One of the world's most liveable cities， the 2016 Mercer Quality of Living Survey ranked Wellington 12th in the world， and was first in the world for both liveability and non-pollution by Deutsche Bank， from 2017–18.Wellington's economy is primarily service-based， with an emphasis on finance， business services， and government. It is the centre of New Zealand's film and special effects industries， and increasingly a hub for information technology and innovation， with two public research universities. Wellington is one of New Zealand's chief seaports and serves both domestic and international shipping. The city is served by Wellington International Airport， the third busiest airport in the country. Wellington's transport network includes train and bus lines which reach as far as the Kapiti Coast and the Wairarapa， and ferries connect the city to the South Island.//new_line//Described by Lonely Planet in 2013 as \"the coolest little capital in the world\"， the global city has grown from a bustling Māori settlement， to a remote colonial outpost， and from there to an Australasian capital experiencing a \"remarkable creative resurgence\"."

  "abstract": "Oslo ( OZ-loh， also US:  OSS-loh， Norwegian: [ˈʊ̂ʂlʊ] (listen)， rarely [ˈʊ̂slʊ， ˈʊ̀ʂlʊ]) is the capital and most populous city of Norway. It constitutes both a county and a municipality. As of 23 November 2020， the municipality of Oslo had a population of 697，549， while the population of the city's greater urban area was 1，019，513， as of 4 November 2019. The metropolitan area had an estimated population of 1.71 million.During the Viking Age the area was part of Viken. Oslo was founded as a city at the end of the Viking Age in the year 1040 under the name Ánslo， and established as a kaupstad or trading place in 1048 by Harald Hardrada. The city was elevated to a bishopric in 1070 and a capital under Haakon V of Norway around 1300. Personal unions with Denmark from 1397 to 1523 and again from 1536 to 1814 reduced its influence. After being destroyed by a fire in 1624， during the reign of King Christian IV， a new city was built closer to Akershus Fortress and named Christiania in honour of the king. It became a municipality (formannskapsdistrikt) on 1 January 1838. The city functioned as the capital of Norway during the 1814–1905 union between Sweden and Norway. From 1877， the city's name was spelled Kristiania in government usage， a spelling that was adopted by the municipal authorities in 1897. In 1925， the city， after incorporating the village retaining its former name， was renamed Oslo. In 1948 Oslo merged with Aker， a municipality which surrounded the capital and which was 27 times larger， thus creating the modern， much larger Oslo municipality.//new_line//Oslo is the economic and governmental centre of Norway. The city is also a hub of Norwegian trade， banking， industry and shipping. It is an important centre for maritime industries and maritime trade in Europe. The city is home to many companies within the maritime sector， some of which are among the world's largest shipping companies， shipbrokers and maritime insurance brokers. Oslo is a pilot city of the Council of Europe and the European Commission intercultural cities programme.//new_line//Oslo is considered a global city and was ranked \"Beta World City\" in studies carried out by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network in 2008. It was ranked number one in terms of quality of life among European large cities in the European Cities of the Future 2012 report by fDi magazine. A survey conducted by ECA International in 2011 placed Oslo as the second most expensive city in the world for living expenses after Tokyo. In 2013 Oslo tied with the Australian city of Melbourne as the fourth most expensive city in the world， according to the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU)'s Worldwide Cost of Living study. Oslo was ranked as the 24th most liveable city in the world by Monocle magazine.Oslo's population was increasing at record rates during the early 2000s， making it the fastest growing major city in Europe at the time. This growth stems for the most part from international immigration and related high birth rates， but also from intra-national migration. By 2010 the immigrant population in the city was growing somewhat faster than the Norwegian population， and in the city proper this had become more than 25% of the total population if the children of immigrant parents are included."

  "abstract": "Manila ( mə-NIH-lə， Spanish: [ma'nila]; Filipino: Maynila， pronounced [majˈnilaʔ])， officially the City of Manila (Filipino: Lungsod ng Maynila [luŋˈsod nɐŋ majˈnilaʔ])， is the capital of the Philippines， and its second most populous city. It is highly urbanized and as of 2019 was the world's most densely populated city proper. It was the first chartered city in the country， designated as such by the Philippine Commission Act 183 of July 31， 1901. It became autonomous with the passage of Republic Act No. 409， \"The Revised Charter of the City of Manila，\" on June 18， 1949. Manila， along with Mexico City and Madrid， has been considered to be one of the world's earliest global cities， because its commercial networks were the first to extend across the Pacific Ocean and connect Asia with the Spanish Americas. When this was accomplished， it marked the first time in world history that an uninterrupted chain of trade routes circling the planet had been established. Manila is the second most natural-disaster-afflicted capital city in the world after Tokyo. At the same time， it is nevertheless among the most populous and fastest growing cities in Southeast Asia.The Spanish city of Manila was founded on June 24， 1571， by Spanish conquistador Miguel López de Legazpi. This is regarded as the city's official founding date; however， a  Tagalog-fortified polity called Maynilà had already existed on the site， dating back as far as 1258. It is the name of this old polity from which the Spanish and English name Manila derives. After the defeat of the polity's last indigenous Rajah， Sulayman III， in the Battle of Bangkusay， a fortified Spanish city called Intramuros was built directly on top of the site of old Maynilà. Manila was the seat of power for most of the country's colonial rulers. Today， it is home to many historic sites， some of which were built during the 16th century. Many of the Philippines' \"firsts\" are in Manila， including the first university (1590)， light station (1642)， lighthouse tower (1846)， water system (1878)， hotel (1889)， electricity (1895)， oceanarium (1913)， stock exchange (1927)， flyover (1930s)， zoo (1959)， pedestrian underpass (1960)， science high school (1963)， city-run university (1965)， city-run hospital (1969)， and rapid transit system (1984) – also considered to be the first rapid transit system in all of Southeast Asia).The term \"Manila\" is commonly used to refer to the whole metropolitan area， the greater metropolitan area or the city proper. The officially defined metropolitan area， called Metro Manila， the \"capital region\" of the Philippines， also includes the much larger Quezon City and the Makati Central Business District.

The metropolis stands on the Vistula River in east-central Poland and its population is officially estimated at 1.8 million residents within a greater metropolitan area of 3.1 million residents， which makes Warsaw the 7th most-populous capital city in the European Union. The city area measures 517.24 square kilometres (199.71 sq mi)， while the metropolitan area covers 6，100.43 square kilometres (2，355.39 sq mi). Warsaw is an alpha-global city， a major international tourist destination， and a significant cultural， political， and economic hub. Its historical Old Town was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.//new_line//The city rose to prominence in the late 16th century， when Sigismund III decided to move the Polish capital and his royal court from Kraków. The elegant architecture，  grandeur and extensive boulevards earned Warsaw the nickname 'Paris of the North' prior to the Second World War. Bombed at the start of the German invasion in 1939， the city withstood a siege， but was largely destroyed by the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in 1943， the general Warsaw Uprising in 1944 and the systematic razing by the Germans in advance of the Vistula–Oder Offensive. Warsaw gained the new title of Phoenix City because of its complete reconstruction after the war， which had left over 85% of its buildings in ruins.In 2012， the Economist Intelligence Unit ranked Warsaw as the 32nd most liveable city in the world. In 2017， the city came 4th in the \"Business-friendly\"， 8th in \"Human capital and life style\" and topped the quality of life rankings in the region. The city is a significant centre of research and development， business process outsourcing， and information technology outsourcing. The Warsaw Stock Exchange is the largest and most important in Central and Eastern Europe. Frontex， the European Union agency for external border security as well as ODIHR， one of the principal institutions of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe have their headquarters in Warsaw. Jointly with Frankfurt and Paris， Warsaw features one of the highest number of skyscrapers in the European Union.The city is the seat of the Polish Academy of Sciences， National Philharmonic Orchestra， University of Warsaw， the Warsaw University of Technology， the National Museum， Zachęta Art Gallery and the Warsaw Grand Theatre， the largest of its kind in the world. The Old Town， which represents examples of nearly every European architectural style and historical period， was listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1980. Other main architectural attractions include the Royal Castle and the iconic King Sigismund's Column， the Wilanów Palace， the Palace on the Isle， St. John's Cathedral， Main Market Square， as well as numerous churches and mansions along the Royal Route. Warsaw is positioning itself as Central and Eastern Europe's chic cultural capital with thriving art or club scenes and restaurants， with around a quarter of the city's area occupied by parks."

Social tensions erupted in the genocide that followed， with Hutu extremists loyal to the interim government killing an estimated 500，000–800，000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu nationwide. The RPF resumed fighting， ending a cease-fire of more than a year. They gradually took control of most of the country and seized Kigali on 4 July 1994. Post-genocide Kigali has experienced rapid population growth， with much of the city rebuilt.//new_line//The city of Kigali is one of the five provinces of Rwanda， with boundaries set in 2006.

The city also hosts the main residence and offices of the president of Rwanda and most government ministries. The largest contributor to Kigali's gross domestic product is the service sector， but a significant proportion of the population works in agriculture including small-scale subsistence farming.

Located in the center of the an-Nafud desert， on the eastern part of the Najd plateau， the city sits at an average of 600 metres (2，000 ft) above sea level， and receives around 5 million tourists each year， making it the forty-ninth most visited city in the world and the 6th in the Middle East. Riyadh had a population of 7.6 million people in 2019， making it the  most-populous city in Saudi Arabia， 3rd most populous in the Middle East， and 38th most populous in Asia.The first mentioning of the city by the name Riyadh was in 1590， by an early Arab chronicler. In 1737， Deham Ibn Dawwas， who was from the neighboring Manfuha， settled in and took control of the city. Deham built a wall around the city， and the best-known source of the name Riyadh is from this period， thought to be referring to the earlier oasis towns that predated the wall built by Ibn Dawwas. In 1744， Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab formed an alliance with the Emir of Dir'iyah， Muhammad bin Saud， and in 1774， they took Riyadh from Deham. However their state， now known as the First Saudi State， came to a collapse in 1818. Turki ibn Abdullah founded the Second Saudi State in the early 19th century and made Riyadh his capital in 1825. However， his reign over the city was disrupted by a joint Ottoman–Rashidi alliance. Finally， in the early 20th century， 'Abdulaziz ibn Saud， known in the west simply as Ibn Saud， retrieved his ancestral kingdom of Najd in 1902 and consolidated his rule by 1926 with the final Saudi conquest of Hejaz.

It is located at the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers and the crossroads of the Pannonian Plain and the Balkan Peninsula. Nearly 1.7 million people live within the administrative limits of the City of Belgrade， a quarter of the total population of Serbia.Belgrade is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in Europe and the World. One of the most important prehistoric cultures of Europe， the Vinča culture， evolved within the Belgrade area in the 6th millennium BC. In antiquity， Thraco-Dacians inhabited the region and， after 279 BC， Celts settled the city， naming it Singidūn. It was conquered by the Romans under the reign of Augustus and awarded Roman city rights in the mid-2nd century. It was settled by the Slavs in the 520s， and changed hands several times between the Byzantine Empire， the Frankish Empire， the Bulgarian Empire， and the Kingdom of Hungary before it became the seat of the Serbian king Stefan Dragutin in 1284. Belgrade served as capital of the Serbian Despotate during the reign of Stefan Lazarević， and then his successor Đurađ Branković returned it to the Hungarian king in 1427. Noon bells in support of the Hungarian army against the Ottoman Empire during the siege in 1456 have remained a widespread church tradition to this day. In 1521， Belgrade was conquered by the Ottomans and became the seat of the Sanjak of Smederevo. It frequently passed from Ottoman to Habsburg rule， which saw the destruction of most of the city during the Ottoman–Habsburg wars. //new_line//In the period after the Serbian Revolution， Belgrade was again named the capital of Serbia in 1841. Northern Belgrade remained the southernmost Habsburg post until 1918， when it was attached to the city， due to former Austro-Hungarian territories becoming part of the new Kingdom of Serbs， Croats and Slovenes after World War I. Belgrade was the capital of Yugoslavia from its creation in 1918 to its dissolution in 2006. In a fatally strategic position， the city has been battled over in 115 wars and razed 44 times， being bombed five times and besieged many times.Being Serbia's primate city， Belgrade has special administrative status within Serbia. It is the seat of the central government， administrative bodies， and government ministries， as well as home of almost all of the largest Serbian companies， media， and scientific institutions. Belgrade is classified as a Beta-Global City. The city is home to the Clinical Centre of Serbia， one of the hospital complexes with the largest capacity in the world， the Church of Saint Sava， one of the largest Orthodox church buildings， and the Štark Arena， one of the indoor arenas with the largest capacity in Europe. Belgrade hosted major international events such as the Danube River Conference of 1948， the first Non-Aligned Movement Summit (1961)， the first major gathering of the OSCE (1977–1978)， Eurovision Song Contest (2008)， as well as sports events such as the first FINA World Aquatics Championships (1973)， UEFA Euro (1976)， Summer Universiade (2009) and EuroBasket three times (1961， 1975， 2005)."

As of January 2020， Dushanbe had a population of 863，400 and as of 2010 that population was largely Tajik. Until 1929， the city was known in Russian as Dyushambe (Russian: Дюшамбе， Dyushambe)， and from 1929 to 1961 as Stalinabad (Tajik: Сталинобод， Stalinobod)， after Joseph Stalin. Dushanbe is located in the Gissar Valley， bounded by the Gissar Range in the north and east and the Babatag， Aktau， Rangontau and Karatau mountains in the south， and has an elevation of 750–900 m. The city is divided into four districts， all named after historical figures: Ismail Samani， Avicenna， Ferdowsi， and Shah Mansur.//new_line//In ancient times， what is now or is close to modern Dushanbe was settled by various empires and peoples， including Mousterian tool-users， various neolithic cultures， the Achaemenid Empire， Greco-Bactria， the Kushan Empire， and the Hephthalites. In the Middle Ages， more settlements began near modern-day Dushanbe such as Hulbuk and its famous palace. From the 17th century to the early 20th， Dushanbe began to grow into a market village controlled at times by the Beg of Hisor， Balkh， and finally Bukhara. Soon after the Russian invasion in 1922， the town was made the capital of the Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in 1924， which commenced Dushanbe's development and rapid population growth that continued until the Tajik Civil War. After the war， the city became capital of an independent Tajikistan and continued its growth and development into a modern city that today is home to many international conferences.//new_line//Dushanbe's modern culture had its beginnings in the 1920s， where Soviet music， opera， theater， sculpture， film， and sports all began. Music， primarily shashmaqam before the Soviet invasion， took off in the city due to Russian influence and local opera houses and symphonies. Tajik figures such as Sadriddin Ayni contributed greatly to the development of Dushanbe's literature， which went through many changes during and after the Soviet period. Theater and film both saw their beginnings in the 1930s and were heavily influenced by Soviet trends. The architecture of Dushanbe， once neoclassical， transitioned to a minimalist and eventually modern style. The city is a center for newspapers， radio stations， and television of the country， with almost 200 newspapers and more than a dozen television studios operating in 1999.//new_line//Much of Dushanbe's education system dates from Soviet times and has a legacy of state control; today the largest university in Dushanbe， the Tajik National University， is funded by the government. Dushanbe International Airport is the primary airport serving the city. Other forms of transport include the trolleybus system dating from 1955， the small rail system， and the roads that traverse the city. Dushanbe's electricity is primarily hydroelectric， produced by the Nurek Dam， and the aging water system dates from 1932. Tajikistan's healthcare system is concentrated in Dushanbe， meaning that the major hospitals of the country are in the city. The city makes up 20% of Tajikistan's GDP and has large industrial， financial， retail， and tourism sectors. Parks and main sights of the city include Victory Park， Rudaki Park， the Tajikistan National Museum， the Dushanbe Flagpole， and the Tajikistan National Museum of Antiquities."

  "abstract": "Bangkok is the capital and most populous city of Thailand. It is known in Thai as Krung Thep Maha Nakhon or simply Krung Thep. The city occupies 1，568.7 square kilometres (605.7 sq mi) in the Chao Phraya River delta in central Thailand and has an estimated population of 10.539 million as of 2020， 15.3 percent of the country's population. Over fourteen million people (22.2 percent) lived within the surrounding Bangkok Metropolitan Region at the 2010 census， making Bangkok an extreme primate city， dwarfing Thailand's other urban centres in both size and importance to the national economy.//new_line//Bangkok traces its roots to a small trading post during the Ayutthaya Kingdom in the 15th century， which eventually grew and became the site of two capital cities: Thonburi in 1768 and Rattanakosin in 1782. Bangkok was at the heart of the modernization of Siam， later renamed Thailand， during the late-19th century， as the country faced pressures from the West. The city was at the centre of Thailand's political struggles throughout the 20th century， as the country abolished absolute monarchy， adopted constitutional rule， and underwent numerous coups and several uprisings. The city， incorporated as a special administrative area under the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration in 1972， grew rapidly during the 1960s through the 1980s and now exerts a significant impact on Thailand's politics， economy， education， media and modern society.//new_line//The Asian investment boom in the 1980s and 1990s led many multinational corporations to locate their regional headquarters in Bangkok. The city is now a regional force in finance and business. It is an international hub for transport and health care， and has emerged as a centre for the arts， fashion， and entertainment. The city is known for its street life and cultural landmarks， as well as its red-light districts. The Grand Palace and Buddhist temples including Wat Arun and Wat Pho stand in contrast with other tourist attractions such as the nightlife scenes of Khaosan Road and Patpong. Bangkok is among the world's top tourist destinations， and has been named the world's most visited city consistently in several international rankings.//new_line//Bangkok's rapid growth coupled with little urban planning has resulted in a haphazard cityscape and inadequate infrastructure. Despite an extensive expressway network， an inadequate road network and substantial private car usage have led to chronic and crippling traffic congestion， which caused severe air pollution in the 1990s. The city has since turned to public transport in an attempt to solve the problem， operating five rapid transit lines and building other public transit， but congestion still remains a prevalent issue. The city faces long-term environmental threats such as land subsidence， which contributes to frequent flooding， an issue expected to be exacerbated by sea level rise and other effects of climate change."

The Ottomans made the city the capital first of the Anatolia Eyalet (1393–late 15th century)， and then the Angora Vilayet (1867–1922). The historical center of Ankara is a rocky hill rising 150 m (500 ft) over the left bank of the Ankara River， a tributary of the Sakarya River. The hill remains crowned by the ruins of Ankara Castle. Although few of its outworks have survived， there are well-preserved examples of Roman and Ottoman architecture throughout the city， the most remarkable being the 20 BC Temple of Augustus and Rome that boasts the Monumentum Ancyranum， the inscription recording the Res Gestae Divi Augusti.On 23 April 1920， the Grand National Assembly of Turkey was established in Ankara， which became the headquarters of the Turkish National Movement during the Turkish War of Independence. Ankara became the new Turkish capital upon the establishment of the Republic on 29 October 1923， succeeding in this role the former Turkish capital Istanbul (Constantinople) following the fall of the Ottoman Empire. The government is a prominent employer， but Ankara is also an important commercial and industrial city， located at the centre of Turkey's road and railway networks. The city gave its name to the Angora wool shorn from Angora rabbits， the long-haired Angora goat (the source of mohair)， and the Angora cat. The area is also known for its pears， honey and muscat grapes. Although situated in one of the driest regions of Turkey and surrounded mostly by steppe vegetation (except for the forested areas on the southern periphery)， Ankara can be considered a green city in terms of green areas per inhabitant， at 72 square metres (775 square feet) per head."

During its history， Kyiv， one of the oldest cities in Eastern Europe， passed through several stages of prominence and obscurity. The city probably existed as a commercial center as early as the 5th century. A Slavic settlement on the great trade route between Scandinavia and Constantinople， Kyiv was a tributary of the Khazars， until its capture by the Varangians (Vikings) in the mid-9th century. Under Varangian rule， the city became a capital of the Kievan Rus'， the first East Slavic state. Completely destroyed during the Mongol invasions in 1240， the city lost most of its influence for the centuries to come. It was a provincial capital of marginal importance in the outskirts of the territories controlled by its powerful neighbours， first Lithuania， then Poland and Russia.The city prospered again during the Russian Empire's Industrial Revolution in the late 19th century. In 1918， after the Ukrainian People's Republic declared independence from Soviet Russia， Kyiv became its capital. From 1921 onwards Kyiv was a city of Soviet Ukraine， which was proclaimed by the Red Army， and， from 1934， Kyiv was its capital. The city was almost completely ruined during World War II but quickly recovered in the postwar years， remaining the Soviet Union's third-largest city.//new_line//Following the collapse of the Soviet Union and Ukrainian independence in 1991， Kyiv remained Ukraine's capital and experienced a steady influx of ethnic Ukrainian migrants from other regions of the country. During the country's transformation to a market economy and electoral democracy， Kyiv has continued to be Ukraine's largest and wealthiest city. Its armament-dependent industrial output fell after the Soviet collapse， adversely affecting science and technology， but new sectors of the economy such as services and finance facilitated Kyiv's growth in salaries and investment， as well as providing continuous funding for the development of housing and urban infrastructure. Kyiv emerged as the most pro-Western region of Ukraine; parties advocating tighter integration with the European Union dominate during elections."

The city was named for George Washington， the first president of the United States and a Founding Father， and the federal district is named after Columbia， a female personification of the nation. As the seat of the U.S. federal government and several international organizations， the city is an important world political capital. It is one of the most visited cities in the U.S.， with over 20 million visitors in 2016.The U.S. Constitution provided for a federal district under the exclusive jurisdiction of U.S. Congress; the district is therefore not a part of any U.S. state. The signing of the Residence Act on July 16， 1790， approved the creation of a capital district located along the Potomac River near the country's East Coast. The City of Washington was founded in 1791 to serve as the national capital. In 1801， the land， formerly part of Maryland and Virginia (including the settlements of Georgetown and Alexandria)， officially became recognized as the federal district.

Following the collapse of Âu Lạc， the city was part of colonial China. In 1010， Vietnamese emperor Lý Thái Tổ established the capital of the imperial Vietnamese nation Đại Việt in modern-day central Hanoi， naming the city Thăng Long (literally \"Ascending Dragon\"). Thăng Long remained Đại Việt's political centre until 1802， when the Nguyễn dynasty， the last imperial Vietnamese dynasty， moved the capital to Huế. The city was renamed Hanoi in 1831， and served as the capital of French Indochina from 1902 to 1945. On 6 January 1946， the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam designated Hanoi as the capital of the newly-independent country， which would last during the First Indochina War (1946–1954) and the Vietnam War (1955–1975).//new_line//Hanoi has been the capital of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam since 1976.

  "abstract": "Jerusalem (; Hebrew: יְרוּשָׁלַיִם‎ Yerushaláyim; Arabic: القُدس‎ al-Quds or Bayt al-Maqdis， also spelled Baitul Muqaddas) is a city in Western Asia， on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. It is one of the oldest cities in the world， and is considered holy to the three major Abrahamic religions—Judaism， Christianity， and Islam. Both Israel and the Palestinian Authority claim Jerusalem as their capital， as Israel maintains its primary governmental institutions there and the State of Palestine ultimately foresees it as its seat of power; however， neither claim is widely recognized internationally.Throughout its long history， Jerusalem has been destroyed at least twice， besieged 23 times， captured and recaptured 44 times， and attacked 52 times. The part of Jerusalem called the City of David shows first signs of settlement in the 4th millennium BCE， in the shape of encampments of nomadic shepherds. In the Canaanite period (14th century BCE)， Jerusalem was named as Urusalim on ancient Egyptian tablets， probably meaning \"City of Shalem\" after a Canaanite deity. During the Israelite period， significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 9th century BCE (Iron Age II)， and in the 8th century the city developed into the religious and administrative center of the Kingdom of Judah. In 1538， the city walls were rebuilt for a last time around Jerusalem under Suleiman the Magnificent. Today those walls define the Old City， which has been traditionally divided into four-quarters—known since the early 19th century as the Armenian， Christian， Jewish， and Muslim Quarters. The Old City became a World Heritage Site in 1981， and is on the List of World Heritage in Danger. Since 1860 Jerusalem has grown far beyond the Old City's boundaries. In 2015， Jerusalem had a population of some 850，000 residents， comprising approximately 200，000 secular Jewish Israelis， 350，000 Haredi Jews and 300，000 Palestinians. In 2016， the population was 882，700， of which Jews comprised 536，600 (60.8%)， Muslims 319，800 (36.2%)， Christians 15，800 (1.8%)， and 10，300 unclassified (1.2%).According to the Bible， King David conquered the city from the Jebusites and established it as the capital of the united kingdom of Israel， and his son， King Solomon， commissioned the building of the First Temple. Modern scholars argue that Jews branched out of the Canaanite peoples and culture through the development of a distinct monolatrous – and later monotheistic – religion centered on El/Yahweh， These foundational events， straddling the dawn of the 1st millennium BCE， assumed central symbolic importance for the Jewish people. The sobriquet of holy city (עיר הקודש， transliterated 'ir haqodesh) was probably attached to Jerusalem in post-exilic times. The holiness of Jerusalem in Christianity， conserved in the Septuagint which Christians adopted as their own authority， was reinforced by the New Testament account of Jesus's crucifixion there. In Sunni Islam， Jerusalem is the third-holiest city， after Mecca and Medina. In Islamic tradition， in 610 CE it became the first qibla， the focal point for Muslim prayer (salat)， and Muhammad made his Night Journey there ten years later， ascending to heaven where he speaks to God， according to the Quran. As a result， despite having an area of only 0.9 km2 (3⁄8 sq mi)， the Old City is home to many sites of seminal religious importance， among them the Temple Mount with its Western Wall， Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque， and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Outside the Old City stands the Garden Tomb.//new_line//Today， the status of Jerusalem remains one of the core issues in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War， West Jerusalem was among the areas captured and later annexed by Israel while East Jerusalem， including the Old City， was captured and later annexed by Jordan. Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan during the 1967 Six-Day War and subsequently annexed it into Jerusalem， together with additional surrounding territory. One of Israel's Basic Laws， the 1980 Jerusalem Law， refers to Jerusalem as the country's undivided capital. All branches of the Israeli government are located in Jerusalem， including the Knesset (Israel's parliament)， the residences of the Prime Minister (Beit Aghion) and President (Beit HaNassi)， and the Supreme Court. While the international community rejected the annexation as illegal and treats East Jerusalem as Palestinian territory occupied by Israel， Israel has a stronger claim to sovereignty over West Jerusalem."
